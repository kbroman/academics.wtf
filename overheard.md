Academics can have stupid ideas and say stupid things.

- **space allocated by need or merit** (2022-04-16)

  _At a recent faculty meeting, a colleague expressed concern about the
  need for space in the department: that research opportunities were
  limited because there were no offices to house new hires._

  _The department administrator suggested making use of remote work.
  (Yup, the university is seeing that there are cost savings in not giving
  folks offices.)_

  _The department chair said, "If we keep doing what we do so well, keep
  doing our research and training, they'll be crazy not to support us."
  As if university space has ever been allocated by need or merit._

- **the magic number is five** (2022-05-07)

  _At a recent faculty meeting, in a discussion of the assistant
  professors' progress, there was talk about the value of grants versus
  publications, which then led one colleague to comment on how many
  papers are sufficient. They'd heard that the magic number was five per
  year. "Unless you have a Science or a Nature Methods paper, you want
  five publications per year."_

  _No need to read people's work or think about the importance of their
  ideas. We just count up their publications, maybe weighted by the
  impact factor of the journal in which they appeared._
